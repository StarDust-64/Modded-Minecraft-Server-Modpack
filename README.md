# Modded-Minecraft-Server-Modpack
The modpack for the modded minecraft server from the discord sever "Andromeda". This modpack should use 1.12.2, and probably will be updated at some point.

Make sure you are using the latest version of forge and also make sure that you put the mods in the correct folder.
Go to your file explorer and type in the file exlorer thing %appdata%.minecraft
When you've done that go to your mods folder and create a folder in there titled 1.12.2, make sure you put your mods in there and don't have any other mods in the mods folder that aren't in their specific version's folder.

I may make an update to this.
